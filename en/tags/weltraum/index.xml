That is the goal of the Mission Zero project, which we worked on together on January 29. A total of six children and young people took part. It was about the ISS. It was about temperature, humidity and pressure measurements using appropriate sensors. It was about Python programming on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-03-programmieren-f%C3%BCr-den-weltraum-astro-pi-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 19:24:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-03-programmieren-f%C3%BCr-den-weltraum-astro-pi-workshop/</guid><description>Space, infinite expanses. The year is 2021, and these are the adventures of young developers who write programs together to support the work of the crew of the International Space Station ISS. This is Astro Pi Mission Zero!
The aim of the workshop was to develop a program to measure the current humidity on board the ISS and then communicating this to the astronauts in a personalized message. For this purpose Astro Pi is used on the ISS for this purpose: a small computer with various sensors to measure the current temperature, humidity and air pressure as well as an LED matrix consisting of eight by eight LEDs that can be individually controlled.</description></item></channel></rss>

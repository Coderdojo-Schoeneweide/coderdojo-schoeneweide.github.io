That is the goal of the Mission Zero project, which we worked on together on January 29.

&lt;p>A total of six children and young people took part. It was about the ISS. It was about temperature, humidity and pressure measurements using appropriate sensors. It was about Python programming on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. And on top of that: The workshop took place in cooperation with a South African CoderDojo! Before the programming started, we were able to introduce ourselves to each other in a video call. Partners were found straight away who will send their project together to the astronauts on the ISS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-03-programmieren-f%C3%BCr-den-weltraum-astro-pi-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 19:24:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-03-programmieren-f%C3%BCr-den-weltraum-astro-pi-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Space, infinite expanses. The year is 2021, and these are the adventures of young developers
who write programs together to support the work of the crew of the International Space Station ISS.
This is Astro Pi Mission Zero!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the workshop was to develop a program to measure the current humidity on board the ISS
and then communicating this to the astronauts in a personalized message. For this purpose
Astro Pi is used on the ISS for this purpose: a small computer with various sensors to measure the current
temperature, humidity and air pressure as well as an LED matrix consisting of eight by eight LEDs that can be individually controlled.
LEDs that can be controlled individually. However, in order to be able to test the program locally, we used an emulator
emulator that simulates the functionality of the Astro Pi on a website.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

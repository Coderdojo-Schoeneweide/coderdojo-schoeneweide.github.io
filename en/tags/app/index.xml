that add additional elements to your photo - for example, a pair of whiskers in just the right place.
In our first PocketCode workshop, we designed and programmed our own smart photo filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ran the workshop together with mentors from &lt;a href="https://www.kein-abseits.de/">kein Abseits e.V.&lt;/a>,
so that they can pass on their knowledge to their mentees. Only a few mentees at kein Abseits e.V. have a laptop or tablet,
but at least the parents all have a smartphone. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to use PocketCode. PocketCode runs on the smartphone.
So you program apps with an app! You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be connected to the internet once the app is installed.
Because of the positive experiences we have had with PocketCode, we want to continue using PocketCode to overcome the hurdle of being able to participate in a dojo,
to participate in a dojo and thus actively do something for educational equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pet App</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/octostudio-haustierapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/octostudio-haustierapp/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &amp;ldquo;Pet App&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants get an insight into how to program a digital pet that gets hungry and needs to be fed. OctoStudio is used for this purpose, which is an app for mobile devices that allows you to program apps. After a short round of inspiration, participants, together with their mentors, parents, or alone, use the guide provided by us to program a basic pet app and get to know OctoStudio. In the remaining time, participants can then expand their app.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photo filter app</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/pocketcode-gesichtserkennung/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/pocketcode-gesichtserkennung/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Photo filter app&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an insight into
how to programme intelligent photo filters, so-called &amp;ldquo;lenses&amp;rdquo;, such as those found on Instagram or SnapChat.
PocketCode, an app for mobile devices that can be used to programme apps, is used for this.
After a short, creative warm-up exercise in which the participants design four filters on different topics in a short space of time,
together with their mentor, parents or alone, the participants use the instructions we have put together to create their own photo filter.
instructions to develop their own photo filter.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

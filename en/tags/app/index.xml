OctoStudio is used for this purpose, which is an app for mobile devices that allows you to program apps. After a short round of inspiration, participants, together with their mentors, parents, or alone, use the guide provided by us to program a basic pet app and get to know OctoStudio.</description></item><item><title>Photo filter app</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/pocketcode-gesichtserkennung/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/pocketcode-gesichtserkennung/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Photo filter app&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an insight into how to programme intelligent photo filters, so-called &amp;ldquo;lenses&amp;rdquo;, such as those found on Instagram or SnapChat. PocketCode, an app for mobile devices that can be used to programme apps, is used for this. After a short, creative warm-up exercise in which the participants design four filters on different topics in a short space of time, together with their mentor, parents or alone, the participants use the instructions we have put together to create their own photo filter.</description></item></channel></rss>

After a programming phase, two teams compete against each other: Who can be the first to burst the balloon in the middle of the course?
Line and proximity sensors are used for traversing the course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mBlock programs for controlling the mBots are shared by the participants with on-site mentors, who then execute the programs.
Since the mBots are captured by a camera mounted on the ceiling, participants can follow live to see if their program is working.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

We took part in the CoderDojo on the 11th and 12th with two workshops each entitled “Robot competitions”. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to do with competitions. Instead, similar to the crazy lab in November, there were a wide variety of challenges that had to be mastered with DashBots.</description></item></channel></rss>

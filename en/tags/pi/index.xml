The year is 2021, and these are the adventures of young developers
who write programs together to support the work of the crew of the International Space Station ISS.
This is Astro Pi Mission Zero!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the workshop was to develop a program to measure the current humidity on board the ISS
and then communicating this to the astronauts in a personalized message. For this purpose
Astro Pi is used on the ISS for this purpose: a small computer with various sensors to measure the current
temperature, humidity and air pressure as well as an LED matrix consisting of eight by eight LEDs that can be individually controlled.
LEDs that can be controlled individually. However, in order to be able to test the program locally, we used an emulator
emulator that simulates the functionality of the Astro Pi on a website.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.
If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way.</description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop - Part Two</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station.&amp;rdquo; - Cheer up the everyday life of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). That is the goal of the Mission Zero project, which we worked on together on January 29. A total of six children and young people took part. It was about the ISS. It was about temperature, humidity and pressure measurements using appropriate sensors. It was about Python programming on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-03-programmieren-f%C3%BCr-den-weltraum-astro-pi-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 19:24:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-03-programmieren-f%C3%BCr-den-weltraum-astro-pi-workshop/</guid><description>Space, infinite expanses. The year is 2021, and these are the adventures of young developers who write programs together to support the work of the crew of the International Space Station ISS. This is Astro Pi Mission Zero!
The aim of the workshop was to develop a program to measure the current humidity on board the ISS and then communicating this to the astronauts in a personalized message. For this purpose Astro Pi is used on the ISS for this purpose: a small computer with various sensors to measure the current temperature, humidity and air pressure as well as an LED matrix consisting of eight by eight LEDs that can be individually controlled.</description></item><item><title>Astro Pi - Code in Space</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/python-astropi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/python-astropi/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Astro Pi - Code in Space&amp;rdquo; as part of the project &amp;ldquo;Mission Zero&amp;rdquo; of the RaspberryPi Foundation, participants will be given the opportunity to write a Python programme, to write a Python programme that will then be played on the ISS. Participants can create an animation lasting a maximum of 30 seconds, in which at least the humidity on the ISS is displayed. In addition, participants can greet the astronauts, display the air pressure and temperature or add pictures.</description></item><item><title>Hello Bot, how are you?</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/chatbot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/chatbot/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Hello Bot, how are you?&amp;rdquo; participants will gain insight into how to program chatbots. Chatbots are programs capable of conversing with a user. Participants can choose to use either Scratch or Python.
Depending on the participants&amp;rsquo; progress, when using Scratch, they can also utilize the &amp;ldquo;Text-to-Speech&amp;rdquo; extension and create their own blocks (also known as &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;subroutines&amp;rdquo;).
Learning objectives:
Participants understand what a chatbot is. Participants can make the computer say something.</description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>A total of six children and young people took part. It was about the ISS. It was about temperature, humidity and pressure measurements using appropriate sensors. It was about Python programming on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. And on top of that: The workshop took place in cooperation with a South African CoderDojo! Before the programming started, we were able to introduce ourselves to each other in a video call. Partners were found straight away who will send their project together to the astronauts on the ISS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Minecraft Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-08-minecraft/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-08-minecraft/</guid><description>&lt;p>We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus on January 8th, 2022.
&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/minecraft_image1.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motto this time was &amp;ldquo;MINECRAFT&amp;rdquo;! Or rather Minecraft Redstone. Redstone is an object that serves as a manufacturing recipe. This makes it possible to build lines made of so-called redstone dust. These lines can then transmit redstone signals. This also enables the construction of larger redstone circuits. We showed our young participants how it is possible to build small circuits in Minecraft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chatbot with Scratch 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, we met again on the Wilhelminenhof campus of HTW Berlin and let the children program a chatbot with the help of Scratch.
Once all the children had found their way to us, we got started after a short round of introductions and the question “What is your favorite robot (Bender Futurama!)”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/chatbot_bild1.jpg" alt="" title="Our mentors support children with programming">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The children got to grips well with the week&amp;rsquo;s topic. The first attempts to design a chatbot were accomplished with the support of mentors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Between beetles and building blocks workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop on 20.11.21 at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the motto “Between Beetles and Building Blocks”, our little ladybird Kara and our brick figure Robot Karol helped us to understand the world of programming and algorithms. Kara and Robot Karol are programming environments designed for children and young people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a brief introduction to Kara, the children were able to get to know and operate the program independently. For example, Kara the ladybird can move mushrooms or sit on clover leaves and place them in other places.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gruselige Party zum 10.

CoderDojo is already celebrating its tenth anniversary! And we, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, have turned 2
years old. These milestones need to be celebrated! Just in time for Halloween, we, the CoderDojo
Schöneweide, organized a voluntary spooky birthday party workshop at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.
Wilhelminenhof campus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were delicious homemade cupcakes, balloons, costumes and, of course, young, determined programmers!
Everything a CoderDojo party needs to be a success.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FEZ Phenomena Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-10-25-fez-phaenomenien-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 22:24:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-10-25-fez-phaenomenien-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the fall vacations in Berlin and the FEZ Berlin invited children and their families to marvel, explore and play.

On Saturday morning, 11.09.21, everything revolved around how we can improve the world with games. There are two questions we need to answer. Firstly, what does it actually mean to make the world a better place? Secondly, how can we do this with games? To approach these questions naturally, we first discussed our favorite games.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Your own lens</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-08-20-deine-eigene-lense/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-08-20-deine-eigene-lense/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Friday, 20.08.2021, three mentors held a workshop on the topic of “Your own Lense”.
Four children and their parents took part in the workshop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/deine-eigene-lense_foto1.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea for our workshop was for the children to program their own photo filters with the “Pocket Code” app and have fun doing so.
At the beginning, we did a short round of introductions to warm up. Then we played a game in which we mentors set a topic for each round.
each round, and the children then designed a matching photo filter on paper in a short space of time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June Workshop 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-06-juni-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-06-juni-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 22.06.2021 we got together and organized a scratch workshop.
It was quite a small workshop this time, so close to the summer vacations, but the small group made the atmosphere very relaxed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always at the beginning of a workshop, the mentors introduced themselves so that the participants knew who they could turn to if they had any questions.
This time, it was also possible for the participants to introduce themselves right at the beginning. This had the advantage that the participants were involved early on
and were thus on the same level as the mentors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scratch Week 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-20-scratch-week/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-20-scratch-week/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just in time for &lt;a href="https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/scratchweek/">Scratch Week&lt;/a>, we held a workshop on 20.05.2021 in which
where children could realize their own projects with the help of Scratch. 8 pupils of different ages took part
and 4 mentors who organized and led the workshop. The theme of the workshop was “Magical Arcade”.
A theme that the children could use as a guide and that gave them plenty of scope for ideas.&lt;/p>

And is it even good the way it does it?&lt;/p>

that add additional elements to your photo - for example, a pair of whiskers in just the right place.
In our first PocketCode workshop, we designed and programmed our own smart photo filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ran the workshop together with mentors from &lt;a href="https://www.kein-abseits.de/">kein Abseits e.V.&lt;/a>,
so that they can pass on their knowledge to their mentees. Only a few mentees at kein Abseits e.V. have a laptop or tablet,
but at least the parents all have a smartphone. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to use PocketCode. PocketCode runs on the smartphone.
So you program apps with an app! You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be connected to the internet once the app is installed.
Because of the positive experiences we have had with PocketCode, we want to continue using PocketCode to overcome the hurdle of being able to participate in a dojo,
to participate in a dojo and thus actively do something for educational equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Make your own games - Our first online workshop”</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2020-09-08-workshop-game-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 13:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2020-09-08-workshop-game-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>Designing a game is quite complicated: You have to think about the story you want to tell,
what graphics or music you need, you have to design user-friendly menus and controls and of course
you also have to manage to motivate the users! Of course, you can&amp;rsquo;t learn all this in a single workshop,

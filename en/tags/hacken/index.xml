Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train.
The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since you can&amp;rsquo;t just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore. And with success! In the end, everyone was able to “steal” each other&amp;rsquo;s secrets stored on the profile and change background images on the website.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

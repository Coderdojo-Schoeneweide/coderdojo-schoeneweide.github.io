&lt;p>We took part in the CoderDojo on the 11th and 12th with two workshops each entitled “Robot competitions”.

This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way. The biggest project - a Discord chat bot - runs in Python.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

We looked at the program “Processing” with children aged 12 and over - for many it was their first time programming with text. How exciting! And really well mastered.
The aim of the workshop was to provide a fun introduction to programming by using Processing to create images and animations. Participants were given a brief introduction to the color theory of the RGB system as used by computer screens.</description></item><item><title>Processing</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/processing/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;Processing&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants learn about the Processing tool, which can be used to generate images and animations. can be generated. To do this, participants take their first steps in programming with Java and solve their first puzzles before inventing their own creative images.
Learning objectives:
Participants can operate the Processing environment Participants know basic processing commands Participants need:
Computer with Java 11, JRE11 and the Processing IDE installed</description></item></channel></rss>

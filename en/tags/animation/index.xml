They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.
With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.
After we had previously held this workshop online, this was the first time it could take place in person.</description></item><item><title>3D-Art with Blender</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/blender/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/blender/</guid><description>In the workshop &amp;ldquo;3D Art with Blender,&amp;rdquo; participants will learn to use the tool Blender to create 3D models. The workshop can be extended by 2 hours to additionally teach participants how to animate models.
Learning objectives:
Participants can navigate the Blender environment. Participants can create simple 3D shapes with Blender. Participants can colorize 3D models. Participants can animate 3D model Participants will need:
A computer with Blender installed.</description></item><item><title>Animating a music video</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-musikvideo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-musikvideo/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Animating a music video&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an insight into how to make simple animations with Scratch. The animations are created by moving and changing the costumes of characters in Scratch. Depending on the progress of the participants, additional elements such as stage sets can be added.
Learning objectives:
Participants can control the movement of characters in Scratch. Participants understand the difference between characters and costumes. Participants can control the costumes of a character programmatically in Scratch.</description></item><item><title>Dramas with llamas</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-theaterstueck/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-theaterstueck/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Dramas with llamas&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an insight into how to make simple animations with Scratch. The focus of the workshop is on characters speaking and interacting with each other - just like in a theatre play. To ensure that what is said does not overlap, the interaction must be planned in terms of timing: who says what for how long, and so who waits how long? More advanced participants learn how to synchronise the interaction of the characters more efficiently, how to use Scratch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;send&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;receive&amp;rdquo; commands.</description></item><item><title>It speaks!</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-lippensynchronisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-lippensynchronisation/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;It speaks!&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants will gain an insight into how to make fluid animations consisting of individual images with Scratch. In this type of animation, several images are played one after the other, so that a kind of &amp;ldquo;film&amp;rdquo; is created in the mind - like a flip book, but digital! Lip synchronisation is a special type of frame-by-frame animation: a digital figure moves its mouth A digital figure moves the mouth so that the movements match the words spoken.</description></item><item><title>Making digital greeting cards</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-grusskarten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-grusskarten/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Making digital greeting cards&amp;rdquo;, participants will gain an insight into how to make animations with Scratch and create beautiful digital greeting cards. The animations are created through the movement, costume changes and graphic effects of characters in Scratch. Depending on the progress of the participants, other means of animation can also be used, such as cloning figures or using the &amp;ldquo;colouring pen&amp;rdquo;.
Learning objectives:
Participants can play sounds in Scratch Participants can create simple graphics using the Scratch graphics editor.</description></item><item><title>Processing</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/processing/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;Processing&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants learn about the Processing tool, which can be used to generate images and animations. can be generated. To do this, participants take their first steps in programming with Java and solve their first puzzles before inventing their own creative images.
Learning objectives:
Participants can operate the Processing environment Participants know basic processing commands Participants need:
Computer with Java 11, JRE11 and the Processing IDE installed</description></item><item><title>Shared Story</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/gemeinsame-geschichte/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/gemeinsame-geschichte/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;Shared Story&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants first learn what programming is. With the game &amp;ldquo;Living Robot,&amp;rdquo; they get to know the basics of algorithmic thinking. Then, they can take their first steps in programming with Scratch and get to know the programming environment.
Separately from the workshop (e.g., in German and art classes), participants choose a story (e.g., a myth they have studied). This story is divided into small sections and distributed among participant groups.</description></item><item><title>Storyboarding and animations with Scratch</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-animationen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-animationen/</guid><description>In this workshop, participants design animations on topics that concern them in everyday life, such as friendship and the environment. Participants will gain an insight into elements of an animated film and how it is created: Brainstorming, storyboarding, animation and testing.
Learning objectives:
Participants can identify emotion-transporting elements of an animated film concept. Participants can create a storyboard for a scene. Participants can create simple graphics using the Scratch graphics editor.</description></item></channel></rss>

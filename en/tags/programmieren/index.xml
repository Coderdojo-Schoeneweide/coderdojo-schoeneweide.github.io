On May 17th, after a short introduction, we started directly with the robot game. The pupils were faced with the difficult task of programming our robot Ilja so that he could satisfy his hunger for toast with peanut butter. This required many intermediate steps, such as unwrapping the toast and inserting the knife into the peanut butter.</description></item><item><title>Processing Workshop: Programming Pictures and Animations</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 11:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</guid><description>On March 4, we held the Processing-Worksop. We looked at the program “Processing” with children aged 12 and over - for many it was their first time programming with text. How exciting! And really well mastered.
The aim of the workshop was to provide a fun introduction to programming by using Processing to create images and animations. Participants were given a brief introduction to the color theory of the RGB system as used by computer screens.</description></item><item><title>FEZ - The Pixel Worlds February 23</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-02-18-die-pixelwelten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:10:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-02-18-die-pixelwelten/</guid><description>On two weekends, February 11 and 12 and February 18 and 19, kids were able to make their own VR goggles, design PixelArt or play Jump&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;Run SuperMario live in the gym at the FEZ leisure and recreation center.
We took part in the CoderDojo on the 11th and 12th with two workshops each entitled “Robot competitions”. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to do with competitions. Instead, similar to the crazy lab in November, there were a wide variety of challenges that had to be mastered with DashBots.</description></item><item><title>December-Workshop: Animations with Scratch</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</guid><description>On November 26, the workshop “It speaks!” took place, in which participants practiced animating with Scratch. They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.
With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.
After we had previously held this workshop online, this was the first time it could take place in person.</description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors. This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.
If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way.</description></item><item><title>Hack Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-12-htw-hackt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-12-htw-hackt/</guid><description>In movies, hackers often sit in dark rooms, shrouded in eternal night. Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train. The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.
Since you can&amp;rsquo;t just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore.</description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop - Part Two</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station.&amp;rdquo; - Cheer up the everyday life of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).

The motto this time was &amp;ldquo;MINECRAFT&amp;rdquo;! Or rather Minecraft Redstone. Redstone is an object that serves as a manufacturing recipe. This makes it possible to build lines made of so-called redstone dust. These lines can then transmit redstone signals. This also enables the construction of larger redstone circuits. We showed our young participants how it is possible to build small circuits in Minecraft.</description></item><item><title>Chatbot with Scratch 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</guid><description>Last week, we met again on the Wilhelminenhof campus of HTW Berlin and let the children program a chatbot with the help of Scratch. Once all the children had found their way to us, we got started after a short round of introductions and the question “What is your favorite robot (Bender Futurama!)”.
The children got to grips well with the week&amp;rsquo;s topic. The first attempts to design a chatbot were accomplished with the support of mentors.</description></item><item><title>Women in computer science</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-10-frauen-in-der-informatik/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-10-frauen-in-der-informatik/</guid><description>Computer science has its origins in the 19th century. The founder of this science and the first female programmer was Ada Lovelace with her algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine calculating machine. From the beginning of the computer until the 1980s, programming was considered a “typical female profession”. The first electronic computer was used in 1942 for war purposes on behalf of the US Army. Especially during the Second World War, only women did programming, which is now hard to believe, as the computer science industry today only has a very small proportion of women.</description></item><item><title>Between beetles and building blocks workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</guid><description>We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop on 20.11.21 at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.

&lt;p>On May 17th, after a short introduction, we started directly with the robot game. The pupils were faced with the difficult task of programming our robot Ilja so that he could satisfy his hunger for toast with peanut butter. This required many intermediate steps, such as unwrapping the toast and inserting the knife into the peanut butter. The latter ensured that the knife ended up knob first in the jar of peanut butter. In the end, however, Ilya was still able to eat the toast after successful programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>December-Workshop: Animations with Scratch</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>On November 26, the workshop ‚ÄúIt speaks!‚Äù took place, in which participants practiced animating with Scratch.
They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch
and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/teilnehmende.png" alt="" title="Participants of the workshop">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After we had previously held this workshop online, this was the first time it could take place in person.

They are designed to motivate learning enthusiasts such as children, for example, in order to promote fun and learning progress. I asked myself to what extent badges and trophy systems can encourage children to learn programming and how they influence a child&amp;rsquo;s fun and self-motivation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/abzeichen_im_dojo_research_badges_im_coderdojo_1.png" alt="" title="Research badge">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, I first looked at research on the use of badges in education. In order to relate my study to our CoderDojo and the children, I incorporated experiences from our Coding in the Dojo workshop.
It quickly became clear that Scratch was a suitable initial environment for thinking about badge design. So I took a closer look at the functions of Scratch to find out to what extent badges can be integrated here. The result was a huge function tree - everything you can do with Scratch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors.

It was quite a small workshop this time, so close to the summer vacations, but the small group made the atmosphere very relaxed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always at the beginning of a workshop, the mentors introduced themselves so that the participants knew who they could turn to if they had any questions.
This time, it was also possible for the participants to introduce themselves right at the beginning. This had the advantage that the participants were involved early on
and were thus on the same level as the mentors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scratch Week 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-20-scratch-week/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-05-20-scratch-week/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just in time for &lt;a href="https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/scratchweek/">Scratch Week&lt;/a>, we held a workshop on 20.05.2021 in which

how to make simple animations with Scratch.
The focus of the workshop is on characters speaking and interacting with each other - just like in a theatre play.
To ensure that what is said does not overlap, the interaction must be planned in terms of timing:
who says what for how long, and so who waits how long?
More advanced participants learn how to synchronise the interaction of the characters more efficiently,
how to use Scratch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;send&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;receive&amp;rdquo; commands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello Bot, how are you?</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/chatbot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/chatbot/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Hello Bot, how are you?&amp;rdquo; participants will gain insight into how to program chatbots.
Chatbots are programs capable of conversing with a user. Participants can choose to use either Scratch or Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the participants&amp;rsquo; progress, when using Scratch, they can also utilize the &amp;ldquo;Text-to-Speech&amp;rdquo; extension and create their own blocks (also known as &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;subroutines&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning objectives:&lt;/p>

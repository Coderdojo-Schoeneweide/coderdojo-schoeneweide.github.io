With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.
After we had previously held this workshop online, this was the first time it could take place in person.</description></item><item><title>Badges in CoderDojo</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-09-19-abzeichen-im-coderdojo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-09-19-abzeichen-im-coderdojo/</guid><description>Today you can find badges or trophy systems in many learning platforms or learning apps. They are designed to motivate learning enthusiasts such as children, for example, in order to promote fun and learning progress. I asked myself to what extent badges and trophy systems can encourage children to learn programming and how they influence a child&amp;rsquo;s fun and self-motivation.
To do this, I first looked at research on the use of badges in education.</description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors.

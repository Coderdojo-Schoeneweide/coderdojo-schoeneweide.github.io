We looked at the program ‚Äú&lt;em>Processing&lt;/em>‚Äù with children aged 12 and over - for many it was their first time programming with text. How exciting! And really well mastered.&lt;/p>

Bei diesem Workshop ging es darum, einen individuellen Adventskalender mit der Design-Software Figma zu erstellen. Die Teilnehmenden wurden mit einem vorgegebenen Adventskalender-Template ausgestattet, das sie nach ihren eigenen kreativen Vorstellungen gestalten sollten.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>Die 5 Teilnehmenden haben sich bei der Gestaltung des Adventskalenders viele verschiedene M√∂glichkeiten ausgedacht. Einige haben hinter den T√ºrchen Bilder hochgeladen, andere haben eigene kleine Designs erstellt. Ein paar haben sogar die urspr√ºnglich 7 T√ºrchen auf 24 erweitert.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>December-Workshop: Animations with Scratch</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>On November 26, the workshop ‚ÄúIt speaks!‚Äù took place, in which participants practiced animating with Scratch.
They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch
and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.&lt;/p>

Dashbot? - They&amp;rsquo;re those cute little blue robots that you can do all sorts of crazy things with. As part of the crazy lab at the FEZ, interested children were able to let off steam. The highlight is that the robots can be programmed in a beginner-friendly way. This means that all actions can also be carried out automatically. We were on site with mentors to answer any questions. This encouraged the children&amp;rsquo;s experimental curiosity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>L√∂t Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 16:54:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Programming is already pretty cool, but in the cold temperatures our fingers freeze on the keyboards and we look for new challenges. For example, soldering. This was made possible by contacts at xHain and we are happy about this collaboration, even if we had to leave our cozy room in Sch√∂neweide for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You probably already know how our programming workshops work from the other blog articles. If not, then you should definitely read them! But back to soldering. The ten free places were quickly booked up and eight lucky children made it to our workshop. The two who didn&amp;rsquo;t make it were hopefully not quite so sad &amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors. This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/coding_im_dojo_workinprogress.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way. The biggest project - a Discord chat bot - runs in Python.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hack Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-12-htw-hackt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-12-htw-hackt/</guid><description>&lt;p>In movies, hackers often sit in dark rooms, shrouded in eternal night. Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train.
The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since you can&amp;rsquo;t just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore. And with success! In the end, everyone was able to ‚Äústeal‚Äù each other&amp;rsquo;s secrets stored on the profile and change background images on the website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop - Part Two</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station.&amp;rdquo; - Cheer up the everyday life of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).

&lt;p>A total of six children and young people took part. It was about the ISS. It was about temperature, humidity and pressure measurements using appropriate sensors. It was about Python programming on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. And on top of that: The workshop took place in cooperation with a South African CoderDojo! Before the programming started, we were able to introduce ourselves to each other in a video call. Partners were found straight away who will send their project together to the astronauts on the ISS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neues Format: Coding im Dojo</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-15-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-15-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>To get the new year off to a good start, the first Coding im Dojo of the year took place on January 15.

&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/minecraft_image1.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motto this time was &amp;ldquo;MINECRAFT&amp;rdquo;! Or rather Minecraft Redstone. Redstone is an object that serves as a manufacturing recipe. This makes it possible to build lines made of so-called redstone dust. These lines can then transmit redstone signals. This also enables the construction of larger redstone circuits. We showed our young participants how it is possible to build small circuits in Minecraft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chatbot with Scratch 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, we met again on the Wilhelminenhof campus of HTW Berlin and let the children program a chatbot with the help of Scratch.
Once all the children had found their way to us, we got started after a short round of introductions and the question ‚ÄúWhat is your favorite robot (Bender Futurama!)‚Äù.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/chatbot_bild1.jpg" alt="" title="Our mentors support children with programming">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The children got to grips well with the week&amp;rsquo;s topic.

&lt;p>Under the motto ‚ÄúBetween Beetles and Building Blocks‚Äù, our little ladybird Kara and our brick figure Robot Karol helped us to understand the world of programming and algorithms. Kara and Robot Karol are programming environments designed for children and young people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a brief introduction to Kara, the children were able to get to know and operate the program independently. For example, Kara the ladybird can move mushrooms or sit on clover leaves and place them in other places.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gruselige Party zum 10.

On Saturday morning, 11.09.21, everything revolved around how we can improve the world with games. There are two questions we need to answer. Firstly, what does it actually mean to make the world a better place? Secondly, how can we do this with games? To approach these questions naturally, we first discussed our favorite games.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Your own lens</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-08-20-deine-eigene-lense/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-08-20-deine-eigene-lense/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Friday, 20.08.2021, three mentors held a workshop on the topic of ‚ÄúYour own Lense‚Äù.

&lt;p>The idea for our workshop was for the children to program their own photo filters with the ‚ÄúPocket Code‚Äù app and have fun doing so.
At the beginning, we did a short round of introductions to warm up. Then we played a game in which we mentors set a topic for each round.

In our first PocketCode workshop, we designed and programmed our own smart photo filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ran the workshop together with mentors from &lt;a href="https://www.kein-abseits.de/">kein Abseits e.V.&lt;/a>,
so that they can pass on their knowledge to their mentees. Only a few mentees at kein Abseits e.V. have a laptop or tablet,
but at least the parents all have a smartphone. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to use PocketCode. PocketCode runs on the smartphone.
So you program apps with an app! You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be connected to the internet once the app is installed.
Because of the positive experiences we have had with PocketCode, we want to continue using PocketCode to overcome the hurdle of being able to participate in a dojo,
to participate in a dojo and thus actively do something for educational equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>‚ÄúMake your own games - Our first online workshop‚Äù</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2020-09-08-workshop-game-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 13:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2020-09-08-workshop-game-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>Designing a game is quite complicated: You have to think about the story you want to tell,

that add additional elements to your photo - for example, a pair of whiskers in just the right place.
In our first PocketCode workshop, we designed and programmed our own smart photo filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ran the workshop together with mentors from &lt;a href="https://www.kein-abseits.de/">kein Abseits e.V.&lt;/a>,
so that they can pass on their knowledge to their mentees. Only a few mentees at kein Abseits e.V. have a laptop or tablet,
but at least the parents all have a smartphone. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to use PocketCode. PocketCode runs on the smartphone.
So you program apps with an app! You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be connected to the internet once the app is installed.
Because of the positive experiences we have had with PocketCode, we want to continue using PocketCode to overcome the hurdle of being able to participate in a dojo,
to participate in a dojo and thus actively do something for educational equality.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

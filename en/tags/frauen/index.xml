The founder of this science and the first female programmer
was Ada Lovelace with her algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine calculating machine.
From the beginning of the computer until the 1980s, programming was considered a “typical female profession”. The first electronic
computer was used in 1942 for war purposes on behalf of the US Army.
Especially during the Second World War, only women did programming, which is now hard to believe, as the
computer science industry today only has a very small proportion of women. Back then, the reputation of a female programmer
was not as special or outstanding as it is today, but rather that of a modern secretary.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

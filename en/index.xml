&lt;p>In the third semester of the Master&amp;rsquo;s degree course in Business Communication, I was able to encounter the development of the project and soon-to-be association CoderDojo Schöneweide at HTW Berlin. At the information event, I particularly liked the motivation and vision of confronting children of a young age with the world of programming in a playful way. I have no in-depth understanding of this myself, but wanted to support the young team with other knowledge and skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Myth Workshop at Karlshorst Elementary School</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-06-16-sagen-workshop-an-der-grundschule-karlshorst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 09:25:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-06-16-sagen-workshop-an-der-grundschule-karlshorst/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 17.05.2023 and 24.05.2023 we were at the Karlshorst elementary school and organized a Scratch workshop on the topic of sagas together with the 6th grade students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On May 17th, after a short introduction, we started directly with the robot game. The pupils were faced with the difficult task of programming our robot Ilja so that he could satisfy his hunger for toast with peanut butter. This required many intermediate steps, such as unwrapping the toast and inserting the knife into the peanut butter. The latter ensured that the knife ended up knob first in the jar of peanut butter. In the end, however, Ilya was still able to eat the toast after successful programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project of the Karlshorst School</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/dojo-projects/karlshorster_schule/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 19:08:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/dojo-projects/karlshorster_schule/</guid><description>&lt;p>This short story was created in cooperation with &lt;a href="https://karlshorster-schule.de/">Karlshorster Schule&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scratch inspiration for coding in the dojo</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/dojo-projects/inspiration_coding_im_dojo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 19:08:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/dojo-projects/inspiration_coding_im_dojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was a little inspiration for our Ninjas to show particle effects in Scratch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Processing Workshop: Programming Pictures and Animations</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 11:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</guid><description>&lt;p>On March 4, we held the &lt;em>Processing-Worksop&lt;/em>.

I myself am a student at the HTW and came to the CoderDojo via the selection list of the HTW&amp;rsquo;s AWE modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first impressions were of some really friendly people who are enthusiastic and enjoy what they do.
As well as working on the well thought out workshops, there is a lot going on behind the scenes here.
The impressions I want to share here are just some of those hidden activities that turn into wonderful experiences for children and CoderDojo members alike.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New CMS!</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-01-25-neues-cms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 17:01:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-01-25-neues-cms/</guid><description>&lt;p>As part of our AWE at the HTW, we (Philipp and Jonas) have been working on making our website a little better. You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that something visible to you readers has changed. But when developing websites, a lot happens in the background that you don&amp;rsquo;t usually see directly. Our project was about simplifying the creation of these blog posts. Before our project, the creation of blog articles was much more complicated and very technical. As our team is of course not just made up of tech-savvy people, we wanted to simplify the whole process of creating/editing a blog post. To do this, we looked at a few solutions that make it easy to edit content on websites. We came across a content management system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Figma Prototyping Workshop: Adventskalender-App</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-12-17-figma-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 16:27:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-12-17-figma-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kurz vor Weihnachten fand ein Figma Prototyping Workshop für Kinder im Alter von 6 bis 12 Jahren statt.

They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch
and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.&lt;/p>

Dashbot? - They&amp;rsquo;re those cute little blue robots that you can do all sorts of crazy things with. As part of the crazy lab at the FEZ, interested children were able to let off steam. The highlight is that the robots can be programmed in a beginner-friendly way. This means that all actions can also be carried out automatically. We were on site with mentors to answer any questions. This encouraged the children&amp;rsquo;s experimental curiosity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Löt Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 16:54:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Programming is already pretty cool, but in the cold temperatures our fingers freeze on the keyboards and we look for new challenges.

&lt;p>You probably already know how our programming workshops work from the other blog articles. If not, then you should definitely read them! But back to soldering.

Behavior towards children and young people. The general part defines rules that we would like to see in our dealings
with each other. This includes, for example, respectful behavior, dealing constructively with mistakes and
diversity in word and deed. In the team part, we place particular emphasis on clear and open communication with each other and
independent work. When working with children and young people, a responsible approach is particularly important to us.

They are designed to motivate learning enthusiasts such as children, for example, in order to promote fun and learning progress. I asked myself to what extent badges and trophy systems can encourage children to learn programming and how they influence a child&amp;rsquo;s fun and self-motivation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/abzeichen_im_dojo_research_badges_im_coderdojo_1.png" alt="" title="Research badge">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, I first looked at research on the use of badges in education. In order to relate my study to our CoderDojo and the children, I incorporated experiences from our Coding in the Dojo workshop.
It quickly became clear that Scratch was a suitable initial environment for thinking about badge design. So I took a closer look at the functions of Scratch to find out to what extent badges can be integrated here. The result was a huge function tree - everything you can do with Scratch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors.

Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train.
The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since you can&amp;rsquo;t just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore. And with success!

The founder of this science and the first female programmer
was Ada Lovelace with her algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine calculating machine.
From the beginning of the computer until the 1980s, programming was considered a “typical female profession”. The first electronic
computer was used in 1942 for war purposes on behalf of the US Army.
Especially during the Second World War, only women did programming, which is now hard to believe, as the
computer science industry today only has a very small proportion of women. Back then, the reputation of a female programmer
was not as special or outstanding as it is today, but rather that of a modern secretary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Between beetles and building blocks workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop on 20.11.21 at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>your child&amp;rsquo;s individual learning style, including factors like concentration and their own problem-solving methods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>your child wants to pursue their own project, not yours!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>feel free to assist with problems through targeted questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sometimes, just showing that parents make mistakes too is enough. ;)&lt;/li>

In the first part, the participants deal with topics that are close to their hearts, such as climate protection or equal rights,
and think together about how software influences society. In the next step, the participants design a piece of software that draws attention to a social issue
or that addresses a social problem. Finally, the participants are allowed to realise part of the idea using Scratch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving the World Through Games</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/computerspiele-und-gesellschaft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/computerspiele-und-gesellschaft/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Improving the World Through Games,&amp;rdquo; participants will get a first glimpse into the work of a game designer.

how to make fluid animations consisting of individual images with Scratch.
In this type of animation, several images are played one after the other,
so that a kind of &amp;ldquo;film&amp;rdquo; is created in the mind - like a flip book, but digital!
Lip synchronisation is a special type of frame-by-frame animation: a digital figure moves its mouth
A digital figure moves the mouth so that the movements match the words spoken.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Legal Notice</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/impressum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/impressum/</guid><description>&lt;p>Information according to § 5 TMG.

how to make animations with Scratch and create beautiful digital greeting cards.
The animations are created through the movement, costume changes and graphic effects of characters in Scratch.
Depending on the progress of the participants, other means of animation can also be used, such as cloning figures or using the &amp;ldquo;colouring pen&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning objectives:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Participants can play sounds in Scratch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Participants can create simple graphics using the Scratch graphics editor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Participants will be able to programmatically control the costumes of a character in Scratch.&lt;/li>

After a programming phase, two teams compete against each other: Who can be the first to burst the balloon in the middle of the course?
Line and proximity sensors are used for traversing the course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mBlock programs for controlling the mBots are shared by the participants with on-site mentors, who then execute the programs.
Since the mBots are captured by a camera mounted on the ceiling, participants can follow live to see if their program is working.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pet App</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/octostudio-haustierapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/octostudio-haustierapp/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &amp;ldquo;Pet App&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants get an insight into how to program a digital pet that gets hungry and needs to be fed.

&lt;p>CoderDojo Schöneweide is an organisation that aims to teach children and young people about programming in a fun way.
You can find a short teaser video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NylDKr9dBdE">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-my-child-take-part">Can my child take part?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it would be helpful if they can already read. We also have an upper age limit of 17 years (17 years is ok, 18 is not).
After that, you are welcome to join as a mentor :)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

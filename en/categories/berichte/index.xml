In the third semester of the Master&amp;rsquo;s degree course in Business Communication, I was able to encounter the development of the project and soon-to-be association CoderDojo Schöneweide at HTW Berlin. At the information event, I particularly liked the motivation and vision of confronting children of a young age with the world of programming in a playful way.</description></item><item><title>Myth Workshop at Karlshorst Elementary School</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-06-16-sagen-workshop-an-der-grundschule-karlshorst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 09:25:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-06-16-sagen-workshop-an-der-grundschule-karlshorst/</guid><description>On 17.05.2023 and 24.05.2023 we were at the Karlshorst elementary school and organized a Scratch workshop on the topic of sagas together with the 6th grade students.
On May 17th, after a short introduction, we started directly with the robot game. The pupils were faced with the difficult task of programming our robot Ilja so that he could satisfy his hunger for toast with peanut butter. This required many intermediate steps, such as unwrapping the toast and inserting the knife into the peanut butter.</description></item><item><title>Processing Workshop: Programming Pictures and Animations</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 11:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</guid><description>On March 4, we held the Processing-Worksop. We looked at the program “Processing” with children aged 12 and over - for many it was their first time programming with text. How exciting! And really well mastered.
The aim of the workshop was to provide a fun introduction to programming by using Processing to create images and animations. Participants were given a brief introduction to the color theory of the RGB system as used by computer screens.</description></item><item><title>FEZ - The Pixel Worlds February 23</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-02-18-die-pixelwelten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:10:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-02-18-die-pixelwelten/</guid><description>On two weekends, February 11 and 12 and February 18 and 19, kids were able to make their own VR goggles, design PixelArt or play Jump&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;Run SuperMario live in the gym at the FEZ leisure and recreation center.
We took part in the CoderDojo on the 11th and 12th with two workshops each entitled “Robot competitions”. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to do with competitions. Instead, similar to the crazy lab in November, there were a wide variety of challenges that had to be mastered with DashBots.</description></item><item><title>New CMS!</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-01-25-neues-cms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 17:01:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2023-01-25-neues-cms/</guid><description>As part of our AWE at the HTW, we (Philipp and Jonas) have been working on making our website a little better. You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that something visible to you readers has changed. But when developing websites, a lot happens in the background that you don&amp;rsquo;t usually see directly. Our project was about simplifying the creation of these blog posts. Before our project, the creation of blog articles was much more complicated and very technical.</description></item><item><title>Figma Prototyping Workshop: Adventskalender-App</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-12-17-figma-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 16:27:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-12-17-figma-workshop/</guid><description>Kurz vor Weihnachten fand ein Figma Prototyping Workshop für Kinder im Alter von 6 bis 12 Jahren statt.

Die 5 Teilnehmenden haben sich bei der Gestaltung des Adventskalenders viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten ausgedacht. Einige haben hinter den Türchen Bilder hochgeladen, andere haben eigene kleine Designs erstellt.</description></item><item><title>December-Workshop: Animations with Scratch</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-27-dezember-workshop/</guid><description>On November 26, the workshop “It speaks!” took place, in which participants practiced animating with Scratch. They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.
With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.
After we had previously held this workshop online, this was the first time it could take place in person.</description></item><item><title>FEZ Crazy Lab Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-09-fez-verruecktes-labor-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 17:27:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-11-09-fez-verruecktes-labor-workshop/</guid><description>Last weekend, our Dashbot workshop took place for the second time at the FEZ, a popular event for kids and parents alike. Dashbot? - They&amp;rsquo;re those cute little blue robots that you can do all sorts of crazy things with. As part of the crazy lab at the FEZ, interested children were able to let off steam. The highlight is that the robots can be programmed in a beginner-friendly way. This means that all actions can also be carried out automatically.</description></item><item><title>Löt Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 16:54:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</guid><description>Programming is already pretty cool, but in the cold temperatures our fingers freeze on the keyboards and we look for new challenges. For example, soldering. This was made possible by contacts at xHain and we are happy about this collaboration, even if we had to leave our cozy room in Schöneweide for it.
You probably already know how our programming workshops work from the other blog articles. If not, then you should definitely read them!</description></item><item><title>Our code of conduct</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-09-21-verhaltenskodex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:15:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-09-21-verhaltenskodex/</guid><description>We have recently given some thought to how we want to organize our cooperation in the team of the CoderDojo team as well as in workshops and other events we organize. The result of this have been recorded in our new Code of Conduct!
Our Code of Conduct consists of three parts: General principles of conduct, conduct towards team colleagues and Behavior towards children and young people. The general part defines rules that we would like to see in our dealings with each other.</description></item><item><title>Badges in CoderDojo</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-09-19-abzeichen-im-coderdojo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-09-19-abzeichen-im-coderdojo/</guid><description>Today you can find badges or trophy systems in many learning platforms or learning apps. They are designed to motivate learning enthusiasts such as children, for example, in order to promote fun and learning progress. I asked myself to what extent badges and trophy systems can encourage children to learn programming and how they influence a child&amp;rsquo;s fun and self-motivation.
To do this, I first looked at research on the use of badges in education.</description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors. This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.
If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way.</description></item><item><title>Hack Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-12-htw-hackt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-03-12-htw-hackt/</guid><description>In movies, hackers often sit in dark rooms, shrouded in eternal night. Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train. The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.
Since you can&amp;rsquo;t just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore.</description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop - Part Two</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station.&amp;rdquo; - Cheer up the everyday life of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).

The motto this time was &amp;ldquo;MINECRAFT&amp;rdquo;! Or rather Minecraft Redstone. Redstone is an object that serves as a manufacturing recipe. This makes it possible to build lines made of so-called redstone dust. These lines can then transmit redstone signals. This also enables the construction of larger redstone circuits. We showed our young participants how it is possible to build small circuits in Minecraft.</description></item><item><title>Chatbot with Scratch 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</guid><description>Last week, we met again on the Wilhelminenhof campus of HTW Berlin and let the children program a chatbot with the help of Scratch. Once all the children had found their way to us, we got started after a short round of introductions and the question “What is your favorite robot (Bender Futurama!)”.
The children got to grips well with the week&amp;rsquo;s topic. The first attempts to design a chatbot were accomplished with the support of mentors.</description></item><item><title>Women in computer science</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-10-frauen-in-der-informatik/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-10-frauen-in-der-informatik/</guid><description>Computer science has its origins in the 19th century. The founder of this science and the first female programmer was Ada Lovelace with her algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine calculating machine. From the beginning of the computer until the 1980s, programming was considered a “typical female profession”. The first electronic computer was used in 1942 for war purposes on behalf of the US Army. Especially during the Second World War, only women did programming, which is now hard to believe, as the computer science industry today only has a very small proportion of women.</description></item><item><title>Between beetles and building blocks workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</guid><description>We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop on 20.11.21 at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.
Under the motto “Between Beetles and Building Blocks”, our little ladybird Kara and our brick figure Robot Karol helped us to understand the world of programming and algorithms. Kara and Robot Karol are programming environments designed for children and young people.
After a brief introduction to Kara, the children were able to get to know and operate the program independently.</description></item><item><title>Gruselige Party zum 10.

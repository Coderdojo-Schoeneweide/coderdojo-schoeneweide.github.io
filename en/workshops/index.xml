As the tasks are very open-ended, participants can develop and try out their own solution ideas.
The DashBots A DashBot can be controlled via a connected iPad using the &amp;ldquo;Wonder&amp;rdquo; app. In the Wonder app, the DashBot can be manually controlled (Control), small programming tasks can be played (Robot Saga), and it can be freely programmed (Developer mode).</description></item><item><title>Dramas with llamas</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-theaterstueck/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-theaterstueck/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Dramas with llamas&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an insight into how to make simple animations with Scratch. The focus of the workshop is on characters speaking and interacting with each other - just like in a theatre play. To ensure that what is said does not overlap, the interaction must be planned in terms of timing: who says what for how long, and so who waits how long? More advanced participants learn how to synchronise the interaction of the characters more efficiently, how to use Scratch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;send&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;receive&amp;rdquo; commands.</description></item><item><title>Hello Bot, how are you?</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/chatbot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/chatbot/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Hello Bot, how are you?&amp;rdquo; participants will gain insight into how to program chatbots. Chatbots are programs capable of conversing with a user. Participants can choose to use either Scratch or Python.
Depending on the participants&amp;rsquo; progress, when using Scratch, they can also utilize the &amp;ldquo;Text-to-Speech&amp;rdquo; extension and create their own blocks (also known as &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;subroutines&amp;rdquo;).
Learning objectives:
Participants understand what a chatbot is. Participants can make the computer say something.</description></item><item><title>Improving the world as a software developer</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/softwareentwicklung-und-gesellschaft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/softwareentwicklung-und-gesellschaft/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Improving the world as a software developer&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an initial insight into working as a software developer. In the first part, the participants deal with topics that are close to their hearts, such as climate protection or equal rights, and think together about how software influences society. In the next step, the participants design a piece of software that draws attention to a social issue or that addresses a social problem.</description></item><item><title>Improving the World Through Games</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/computerspiele-und-gesellschaft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/computerspiele-und-gesellschaft/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Improving the World Through Games,&amp;rdquo; participants will get a first glimpse into the work of a game designer. In the first part, participants will discuss whether and how games can positively influence society. Then, participants will design their own game idea and have the opportunity to implement part of the idea using Scratch.
Learning objectives:
Participants will gain an impression of what a game designer does. Participants will be familiar with the fundamental elements of a game concept: story, graphics, sound, micro and macro goals, controls.</description></item><item><title>It speaks!</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-lippensynchronisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-lippensynchronisation/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;It speaks!&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants will gain an insight into how to make fluid animations consisting of individual images with Scratch. In this type of animation, several images are played one after the other, so that a kind of &amp;ldquo;film&amp;rdquo; is created in the mind - like a flip book, but digital! Lip synchronisation is a special type of frame-by-frame animation: a digital figure moves its mouth A digital figure moves the mouth so that the movements match the words spoken.</description></item><item><title>Making digital greeting cards</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-grusskarten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/scratch-grusskarten/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Making digital greeting cards&amp;rdquo;, participants will gain an insight into how to make animations with Scratch and create beautiful digital greeting cards. The animations are created through the movement, costume changes and graphic effects of characters in Scratch. Depending on the progress of the participants, other means of animation can also be used, such as cloning figures or using the &amp;ldquo;colouring pen&amp;rdquo;.
Learning objectives:
Participants can play sounds in Scratch Participants can create simple graphics using the Scratch graphics editor.</description></item><item><title>mBot Obstacle Course</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/mbot-labyrinth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/mbot-labyrinth/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;mBot Obstacle Course,&amp;rdquo; participants navigate an mBot through an obstacle course. After a programming phase, two teams compete against each other: Who can be the first to burst the balloon in the middle of the course? Line and proximity sensors are used for traversing the course.
The mBlock programs for controlling the mBots are shared by the participants with on-site mentors, who then execute the programs. Since the mBots are captured by a camera mounted on the ceiling, participants can follow live to see if their program is working.</description></item><item><title>Pet App</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/octostudio-haustierapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/octostudio-haustierapp/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;Pet App&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants get an insight into how to program a digital pet that gets hungry and needs to be fed. OctoStudio is used for this purpose, which is an app for mobile devices that allows you to program apps. After a short round of inspiration, participants, together with their mentors, parents, or alone, use the guide provided by us to program a basic pet app and get to know OctoStudio.</description></item><item><title>Photo filter app</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/pocketcode-gesichtserkennung/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/pocketcode-gesichtserkennung/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;Photo filter app&amp;rdquo;, participants gain an insight into how to programme intelligent photo filters, so-called &amp;ldquo;lenses&amp;rdquo;, such as those found on Instagram or SnapChat. PocketCode, an app for mobile devices that can be used to programme apps, is used for this. After a short, creative warm-up exercise in which the participants design four filters on different topics in a short space of time, together with their mentor, parents or alone, the participants use the instructions we have put together to create their own photo filter.</description></item><item><title>Processing</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/en/workshops/processing/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;Processing&amp;rdquo; workshop, participants learn about the Processing tool, which can be used to generate images and animations. can be generated.

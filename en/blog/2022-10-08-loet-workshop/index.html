For example, soldering. This was made possible by contacts at xHain and we are happy about this collaboration, even if we had to leave our cozy room in Schöneweide for it.</p><p>You probably already know how our programming workshops work from the other blog articles. If not, then you should definitely read them! But back to soldering. The ten free places were quickly booked up and eight lucky children made it to our workshop. The two who didn&rsquo;t make it were hopefully not quite so sad &mldr;</p><p><img src=/images/cms/loetworkshop_the_team.png alt title="a light goes on for everyone :)"></p><p>So what exactly was soldered? In fact, the kids were able to choose from various kits, all of which contained battery-powered LEDs but depicted different things, including a butterfly or a cat. Two children even dared to try their hand at LED cubes, which require extremely steady hands.</p><p>The aim of the workshop was to learn how to use soldering irons - how to hold them properly (not too far down!), how to use different methods, for example with or without tweezers, and finally how to make the LEDs light up. These goals were achieved and even more, because the eyes of our protégés shone at least as brightly as the LEDs of their works of art, which they were even allowed to take home with them at the end.</p><p>Would you now like to take part in this workshop yourself or send your child? Then sign up for our newsletter or keep an eye on our social media pages, because next year there will be more soldering workshops at xHain. Free of charge, of course.</p><p>See you soon!</p><p>Your CoderDojo team</p></div><ul class=tags><li>#workshop</li></ul></section><script src=/js/blog.js></script></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Made with &lt;3 by the CoderDojo Schöneweide team</p><p>Hosted on GitHub</p><ul><li><a href=/en/impressum/>Legal Notice</a></li><li><a href=/datenschutz>Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script></body></html>

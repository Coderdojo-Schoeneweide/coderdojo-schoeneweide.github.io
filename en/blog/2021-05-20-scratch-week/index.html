where children could realize their own projects with the help of Scratch. 8 pupils of different ages took part
and 4 mentors who organized and led the workshop. The theme of the workshop was “Magical Arcade”.
A theme that the children could use as a guide and that gave them plenty of scope for ideas.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/scratch-week_moinmoin.png title="\\“Moin Moin\\” says the beetle"></p><p>At the beginning of the workshop, the mentors introduced themselves so that the participants knew who to ask if anything was unclear.
Two groups were then formed. The first thing the groups did was to get to know each other. The workshop was particularly interesting
by the fact that the participants had different levels of prior knowledge. Some had already done many projects and were very familiar with Scratch,
while others were taking part for the first time. Before we finally got started, there was a short introduction to Scratch so that everyone could get their bearings.
orientation.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/scratch-week_merlin.png title="Merlin's mission"></p><p>The participants&rsquo; approaches were very diverse. There were short stories in which mythical creatures got to know each other or in which you could experience the everyday life
of a real witch, as well as small games in which magicians fought dragons or spaceships had to avoid asteroids.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/scratch-week_lilly.png title="Lilly the witch"></p><p>Towards the end of the workshop, we gathered again in a large group and showed each other our projects. We were really pleased with how the
participants reacted to each other&rsquo;s results. Especially the participants who didn&rsquo;t have much experience with Scratch were encouraged.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/scratch-week_raumschiff.png title="The spaceship game"></p><p>We had considered asking a short evaluation question beforehand, but this was not necessary as the children said that they had enjoyed it.
had enjoyed it. Of course, we were very pleased about that.</p></div><ul class=tags><li>#workshop</li><li>#einstieg</li><li>#spiel</li><li>#grundschule</li><li>#programmieren</li><li>#scratch</li></ul></section><script src=/js/blog.js></script></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Made with &lt;3 by the CoderDojo Schöneweide team</p><p>Hosted on GitHub</p><ul><li><a href=/en/impressum/>Legal Notice</a></li><li><a href=/datenschutz>Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script><script src=/js/privacy-notice.js></script></body></html>

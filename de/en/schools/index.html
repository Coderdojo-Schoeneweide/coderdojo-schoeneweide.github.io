Our workshops for school classes usually last three hours, spread over one or two days.

We will then contact you with a proposed date for an initial discussion.
Once all framework conditions and the rough workshop content are clarified, we will send your school an offer.</p><p>If you accept this, we will refine our concept for you and prepare everything in consultation with you.
Then we will conduct the workshop, and afterwards your school will receive an invoice, payable by bank transfer.</p><h3 id=costs>Costs</h3><p>Money shouldn&rsquo;t be a barrier to digital education.
The compensation for our offerings for schools is based on the school&rsquo;s budget.

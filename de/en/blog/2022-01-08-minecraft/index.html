<img src=/images/cms/minecraft_image1.jpg alt></p><p>The motto this time was &ldquo;MINECRAFT&rdquo;! Or rather Minecraft Redstone. Redstone is an object that serves as a manufacturing recipe. This makes it possible to build lines made of so-called redstone dust. These lines can then transmit redstone signals. This also enables the construction of larger redstone circuits. We showed our young participants how it is possible to build small circuits in Minecraft.</p><p>After a short introduction, our participants were able to &ldquo;let off steam&rdquo; and try things out in Minecraft Redstone. We first gave small challenges, such as making a lamp light up when two switches are operated. Another challenge was to make a lamp light up when only one of two switches is operated.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/minecraft_image2.jpg alt></p><p><img src=/images/cms/minecraft_image3.jpg alt></p><p>Our young participants were extremely interested, asked questions here and there, but everyone mastered the small challenges. You are great! :) We, your mentors, are very proud of you and you can be very proud of yourselves too! You all did a great job.</p><p>To raise the bar a little higher, there was another challenge that was a little more complex to solve. And that was to build a half adder. A half adder is a type of circuit network or a simple arithmetic circuit.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/minecraft_image6.jpg alt></p><p>But this challenge was also mastered with flying colors! This task took a little longer, but was also solved without any problems. Our participants even raised the bar themselves by building some complex buildings that had this half-adder. You guys are amazing! :) You all did such a great job.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/minecraft_image4.jpg alt></p><p>The two hours flew by. We even extended the workshop because we were all having so much fun. Towards the end of the workshop, there was a short showtime where the kids could present their Minecraft Redstone projects.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/minecraft_image5.jpg alt></p><p>We from CoderDojo Schöneweide had a lot of fun and we look forward to welcoming and supporting you again soon in one of our workshops!</p></section></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Mit &lt;3 gemacht vom CoderDojo Schöneweide Team</p><p>Auf GitHub gehostet</p><ul><li><a href=/de/impressum/>Impressum</a></li><li><a href=/de/datenschutz/>Datenschutz</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script><script src=/js/privacy-notice.js></script></body></html>

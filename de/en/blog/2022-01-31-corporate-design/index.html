As my strengths lie more in the area of design and programming, I looked for an alternative job to mentoring within the Dojo. I was welcomed with open arms and found out with the help of the other members that the team was still looking for someone to take care of the corporate design and revise the current design.</p><h3 id=corporate-design>What is a corporate design?</h3><p>Corporate design generally refers to the appearance of a company or organization. The most important characteristics are recognition value and uniformity<a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Design>^1</a>. Both are ensured by a standardized design with regard to the colors used, the logo, the fonts, as well as image and text styles. A corporate design manual is created for this purpose. This is a document that combines all the elements mentioned and describes how they are to be used. The manual is then available to all members and serves as a guideline for the design of digital and print media.</p><p>Together and in constant consultation, we created a new color palette, selected suitable fonts and tried out new designs together. The result is a reader-friendly and colorful design that should appeal to children and young people as well as parents.</p><h3 id=new-look>New look</h3><p>As an example of the new look, I present a created certificate that combines all the new elements and perfectly describes the aforementioned changes. The certificate itself is distributed to participants at the end of a workshop as a kind of reward and therefore contains a field where a name can be entered.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/corporate_design_zertifikat_orange.png alt title="Final workshop certificate (orange)"></p><p><img src=/images/cms/corporate_design_zertifikat_gruen.png alt title="Final workshop certificate (green)"></p><p>Here you can see two versions of the certificate: one in orange, our <em>primary</em> corporate color. The other is green, one of our <em>secondary</em> corporate colors. We chose Open Sans as our corporate font because it is a very legible and versatile font. As we want to show that CoderDojo Schöneweide has a connection to the global CoderDojo community<a href=https://coderdojo.com/de-DE>^2</a>, the typical modified yin-yang symbol in the top left-hand corner is of course a must.</p><p>All in all, by defining a corporate design together, we have created our own little brand that will hopefully be well received by young readers.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/corporate_design_ninjaicon.svg alt></p><p>I had a very positive experience with the CoderDojo during the winter semester and can warmly recommend the associated AWE to everyone. However, you can also volunteer there, because there is a suitable place for everyone.</p></section></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Mit &lt;3 gemacht vom CoderDojo Schöneweide Team</p><p>Auf GitHub gehostet</p><ul><li><a href=/de/impressum/>Impressum</a></li><li><a href=/de/datenschutz/>Datenschutz</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script><script src=/js/privacy-notice.js></script></body></html>

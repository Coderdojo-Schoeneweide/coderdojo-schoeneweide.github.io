&lt;p>In the third semester of the Master&amp;rsquo;s degree course in Business Communication, I was able to encounter the development of the project and soon-to-be association CoderDojo Schöneweide at HTW Berlin. At the information event, I particularly liked the motivation and vision of confronting children of a young age with the world of programming in a playful way. I have no in-depth understanding of this myself, but wanted to support the young team with other knowledge and skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Myth Workshop at Karlshorst Elementary School</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2023-06-16-sagen-workshop-an-der-grundschule-karlshorst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 09:25:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2023-06-16-sagen-workshop-an-der-grundschule-karlshorst/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 17.05.2023 and 24.05.2023 we were at the Karlshorst elementary school and organized a Scratch workshop on the topic of sagas together with the 6th grade students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On May 17th, after a short introduction, we started directly with the robot game. The pupils were faced with the difficult task of programming our robot Ilja so that he could satisfy his hunger for toast with peanut butter. This required many intermediate steps, such as unwrapping the toast and inserting the knife into the peanut butter. The latter ensured that the knife ended up knob first in the jar of peanut butter. In the end, however, Ilya was still able to eat the toast after successful programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Processing Workshop: Programming Pictures and Animations</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 11:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2023-03-10-processing-workshop-bilder-und-animationen-programmieren/</guid><description>&lt;p>On March 4, we held the &lt;em>Processing-Worksop&lt;/em>. We looked at the program “&lt;em>Processing&lt;/em>” with children aged 12 and over - for many it was their first time programming with text. How exciting! And really well mastered.&lt;/p>

I myself am a student at the HTW and came to the CoderDojo via the selection list of the HTW&amp;rsquo;s AWE modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first impressions were of some really friendly people who are enthusiastic and enjoy what they do.
As well as working on the well thought out workshops, there is a lot going on behind the scenes here.
The impressions I want to share here are just some of those hidden activities that turn into wonderful experiences for children and CoderDojo members alike.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New CMS!</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2023-01-25-neues-cms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 17:01:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2023-01-25-neues-cms/</guid><description>&lt;p>As part of our AWE at the HTW, we (Philipp and Jonas) have been working on making our website a little better. You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that something visible to you readers has changed. But when developing websites, a lot happens in the background that you don&amp;rsquo;t usually see directly. Our project was about simplifying the creation of these blog posts. Before our project, the creation of blog articles was much more complicated and very technical. As our team is of course not just made up of tech-savvy people, we wanted to simplify the whole process of creating/editing a blog post. To do this, we looked at a few solutions that make it easy to edit content on websites. We came across a content management system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Figma Prototyping Workshop: Adventskalender-App</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-12-17-figma-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 16:27:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-12-17-figma-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kurz vor Weihnachten fand ein Figma Prototyping Workshop für Kinder im Alter von 6 bis 12 Jahren statt. Bei diesem Workshop ging es darum, einen individuellen Adventskalender mit der Design-Software Figma zu erstellen. Die Teilnehmenden wurden mit einem vorgegebenen Adventskalender-Template ausgestattet, das sie nach ihren eigenen kreativen Vorstellungen gestalten sollten.&lt;/p>

They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch
and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.&lt;/p>

Dashbot? - They&amp;rsquo;re those cute little blue robots that you can do all sorts of crazy things with. As part of the crazy lab at the FEZ, interested children were able to let off steam. The highlight is that the robots can be programmed in a beginner-friendly way. This means that all actions can also be carried out automatically. We were on site with mentors to answer any questions. This encouraged the children&amp;rsquo;s experimental curiosity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Löt Workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 16:54:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-10-08-loet-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Programming is already pretty cool, but in the cold temperatures our fingers freeze on the keyboards and we look for new challenges. For example, soldering. This was made possible by contacts at xHain and we are happy about this collaboration, even if we had to leave our cozy room in Schöneweide for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You probably already know how our programming workshops work from the other blog articles. If not, then you should definitely read them! But back to soldering. The ten free places were quickly booked up and eight lucky children made it to our workshop. The two who didn&amp;rsquo;t make it were hopefully not quite so sad &amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our code of conduct</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-09-21-verhaltenskodex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:15:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-09-21-verhaltenskodex/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have recently given some thought to how we want to organize our cooperation in the team of the
CoderDojo team as well as in workshops and other events we organize. The result of this
have been recorded in our new Code of Conduct!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Code of Conduct consists of three parts: General principles of conduct, conduct towards team colleagues and
Behavior towards children and young people. The general part defines rules that we would like to see in our dealings
with each other. This includes, for example, respectful behavior, dealing constructively with mistakes and
diversity in word and deed. In the team part, we place particular emphasis on clear and open communication with each other and
independent work. When working with children and young people, a responsible approach is particularly important to us.

we want to serve as positive role models and encourage them in their development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Badges in CoderDojo</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-09-19-abzeichen-im-coderdojo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-09-19-abzeichen-im-coderdojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today you can find badges or trophy systems in many learning platforms or learning apps. They are designed to motivate learning enthusiasts such as children, for example, in order to promote fun and learning progress. I asked myself to what extent badges and trophy systems can encourage children to learn programming and how they influence a child&amp;rsquo;s fun and self-motivation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/abzeichen_im_dojo_research_badges_im_coderdojo_1.png" alt="" title="Research badge">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, I first looked at research on the use of badges in education. In order to relate my study to our CoderDojo and the children, I incorporated experiences from our Coding in the Dojo workshop.
It quickly became clear that Scratch was a suitable initial environment for thinking about badge design. So I took a closer look at the functions of Scratch to find out to what extent badges can be integrated here. The result was a huge function tree - everything you can do with Scratch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coding in March</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-03-19-coding-im-dojo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors. This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/coding_im_dojo_workinprogress.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way.

Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train.
The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since you can&amp;rsquo;t just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore. And with success! In the end, everyone was able to “steal” each other&amp;rsquo;s secrets stored on the profile and change background images on the website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming for Space - Astro Pi Workshop - Part Two</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-01-29-astropi/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station.&amp;rdquo; - Cheer up the everyday life of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).

&lt;img src="https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/images/cms/astro_pi_mission_zero_key_visual.png" alt="" title="Image (above): ESA">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A total of six children and young people took part. It was about the ISS. It was about temperature, humidity and pressure measurements using appropriate sensors. It was about Python programming on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. And on top of that: The workshop took place in cooperation with a South African CoderDojo! Before the programming started, we were able to introduce ourselves to each other in a video call. Partners were found straight away who will send their project together to the astronauts on the ISS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CoderDojo Schöneweide - Corporate Design</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-01-31-corporate-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2022-01-31-corporate-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>I came across the “CoderDojo Schöneweide” project at HTW and wanted to take part in it.

&lt;p>The motto this time was &amp;ldquo;MINECRAFT&amp;rdquo;! Or rather Minecraft Redstone. Redstone is an object that serves as a manufacturing recipe. This makes it possible to build lines made of so-called redstone dust. These lines can then transmit redstone signals. This also enables the construction of larger redstone circuits. We showed our young participants how it is possible to build small circuits in Minecraft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chatbot with Scratch 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-12-11-chatbot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, we met again on the Wilhelminenhof campus of HTW Berlin and let the children program a chatbot with the help of Scratch.

The founder of this science and the first female programmer
was Ada Lovelace with her algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine calculating machine.
From the beginning of the computer until the 1980s, programming was considered a “typical female profession”. The first electronic
computer was used in 1942 for war purposes on behalf of the US Army.
Especially during the Second World War, only women did programming, which is now hard to believe, as the
computer science industry today only has a very small proportion of women. Back then, the reputation of a female programmer
was not as special or outstanding as it is today, but rather that of a modern secretary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Between beetles and building blocks workshop</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-11-24-zwischen-kaefern-und-blaukloetzen-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop on 20.11.21 at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.&lt;/p>

At the beginning, we did a short round of introductions to warm up. Then we played a game in which we mentors set a topic for each round.
each round, and the children then designed a matching photo filter on paper in a short space of time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our first presence dojo during the Corona pandemic - A how-to</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-07-29-erster-live-workshop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-07-29-erster-live-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two weeks before our July workshop, the idea came up that it might be possible to hold it live and outdoors. Enthusiastic about the idea, we first had to find out which framework conditions applied. In the end, the organizational effort was surprisingly easy to manage in 2 weeks:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>The location&lt;/em>&lt;br>
In the shadow of the rising numbers at the end of July, “outside but still with access to electricity” was a relevant key point. By chance and spontaneously, we came across Sebastian from Remili, or Einhorn gGmbH, who was very accommodating. Thank you very much for that! Hopefully future workshops can also take place at Hasselwerderstr. 22A by arrangement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer, sun, games!

&lt;p>Under the open sky in a relaxed picnic atmosphere, all participants were finally able to talk to each other in person.

It was quite a small workshop this time, so close to the summer vacations, but the small group made the atmosphere very relaxed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always at the beginning of a workshop, the mentors introduced themselves so that the participants knew who they could turn to if they had any questions.
This time, it was also possible for the participants to introduce themselves right at the beginning. This had the advantage that the participants were involved early on
and were thus on the same level as the mentors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scratch Week 2021</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-05-20-scratch-week/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2021-05-20-scratch-week/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just in time for &lt;a href="https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/scratchweek/">Scratch Week&lt;/a>, we held a workshop on 20.05.2021 in which
where children could realize their own projects with the help of Scratch. 8 pupils of different ages took part
and 4 mentors who organized and led the workshop. The theme of the workshop was “Magical Arcade”.
A theme that the children could use as a guide and that gave them plenty of scope for ideas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of the workshop was to develop a program to measure the current humidity on board the ISS
and then communicating this to the astronauts in a personalized message. For this purpose
Astro Pi is used on the ISS for this purpose: a small computer with various sensors to measure the current
temperature, humidity and air pressure as well as an LED matrix consisting of eight by eight LEDs that can be individually controlled.
LEDs that can be controlled individually. However, in order to be able to test the program locally, we used an emulator

that add additional elements to your photo - for example, a pair of whiskers in just the right place.
In our first PocketCode workshop, we designed and programmed our own smart photo filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ran the workshop together with mentors from &lt;a href="https://www.kein-abseits.de/">kein Abseits e.V.&lt;/a>,
so that they can pass on their knowledge to their mentees. Only a few mentees at kein Abseits e.V. have a laptop or tablet,
but at least the parents all have a smartphone. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to use PocketCode. PocketCode runs on the smartphone.
So you program apps with an app! You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be connected to the internet once the app is installed.
Because of the positive experiences we have had with PocketCode, we want to continue using PocketCode to overcome the hurdle of being able to participate in a dojo,
to participate in a dojo and thus actively do something for educational equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Make your own games - Our first online workshop”</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2020-09-08-workshop-game-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 13:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/blog/2020-09-08-workshop-game-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>Designing a game is quite complicated: You have to think about the story you want to tell,

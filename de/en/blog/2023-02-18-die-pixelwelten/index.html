With a soccer ball that&rsquo;s almost as big as you are?" title="image: fez pixelworld soccer"></p><p>We didn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with competitions. Instead, similar to the crazy lab in November, there were a wide variety of challenges that had to be mastered with DashBots. These included a labyrinth stuck to the floor, a soccer pitch, a theater round and the - very popular - catapult. The Dashbot can be controlled once at each station using a 2D joystick or programmed in the app.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/pixelwelten2.jpeg alt="Steer through the labyrinth, or next-level: Program!" title="image: fez pixelwelten labyrinth"></p><p>All workshops were fully booked in no time at all. Unfortunately, there were only 6 robots. Sharing and taking turns, all well and good, but four people on a tablet + dashbot? You have to wait forever for your turn. Nevertheless, those who were patient enough had a lot of fun and hopefully also learned something. :-)</p><p>We certainly had both. A lot of fun, all in all a successful event. Even better next time: several shorter workshops, but smaller groups. Until then!</p><p><img src=/images/cms/pixelwelten3.jpeg alt="Don&rsquo;t lose your crown!

The founder of this science and the first female programmer
was Ada Lovelace with her algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine calculating machine.
From the beginning of the computer until the 1980s, programming was considered a “typical female profession”. The first electronic
computer was used in 1942 for war purposes on behalf of the US Army.
Especially during the Second World War, only women did programming, which is now hard to believe, as the
computer science industry today only has a very small proportion of women. Back then, the reputation of a female programmer
was not as special or outstanding as it is today, but rather that of a modern secretary.</p><p>Grace Hopper, an admiral in the US Navy, set a milestone with her work on the first fully electronic calculator Mark I or ASCC
(Automatic Sequence Controller Calculator), she set a milestone in programming language. In 1952, she developed the first compiler
(A-0) in 1952 and, with the FLOW-MATIC programming language and the associated compiler (1957), made significant contributions to the development of the
for the development of the COBOL programming language. She achieved worldwide recognition with the programming language
COBOL (“Common Business Oriented Language”). This was created in the early days of computer development, at the end of the
1950s and is still used today. The style of this programming language is strongly based on natural language
and is primarily used for programming commercial applications. The US computer “ENIAC”, which was used to calculate ballistic
ballistic tables, was also programmed by six women in the 1940s. Kathleen
McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, Jean Bartik, Frances Elizabeth “Betty” Holberton, Marlyn Meltzer, Frances Spence and Ruth
Teitelbaum were known as ENIAC women from this point on and were inducted into the Women in Technology International
(WITI) Hall of Fame in 1997. They had been employed in Aberdeen at various computing machines and in management functions.
had been employed in Aberdeen. The women received special introductory courses on the entire structure of the ENIAC as well as on the
handling the IBM punched card devices for input/output. Furthermore, they were introduced to a block diagram notation method in
in which the respective programs were to be described. As there were no manuals, they had to read the circuit diagrams of the
read circuit diagrams of the system. Their programming instructors were the ENIAC developers themselves. Also thanks to the ladies of creation,
the first landing of a man on the moon. This was only possible thanks to programs by female developers such as
Katherine Johnson and Margaret Hamilton. Johnson calculated the flight path of the Apollo 11 mission, Hamilton
wrote the Apollo flight software. They are also known as “Apollo&rsquo;s women - heroines behind the moon landing”.
In 1983, according to the US National Science Foundation, 37 percent of all IT students in the United States were female.
Today, less than 20 percent of computer science graduates in the USA are female.
In the 1980s in particular, many games were made especially for men and the typical stereotype nerd.
Accordingly, families were more likely to buy computers for their sons than daughters and “being a nerd” became a male thing.
But what about the female representatives of computer science today?</p><p>After the historical review, we now take a closer look at three current greats in computer science:</p><h2 id=jade-raymond>Jade Raymond</h2><p>Jade Raymond stands for the gaming industry like no other and founded the independent developer studio Haven in March 2021.

It was quite a small workshop this time, so close to the summer vacations, but the small group made the atmosphere very relaxed.</p><p>As always at the beginning of a workshop, the mentors introduced themselves so that the participants knew who they could turn to if they had any questions.
This time, it was also possible for the participants to introduce themselves right at the beginning. This had the advantage that the participants were involved early on
and were thus on the same level as the mentors.</p><p>After the round of introductions, the topic was presented. The somewhat jokey topic this time was “Dramas with llamas”. The idea was based on the observation that some of the

The rocket can move to the side and forwards and backwards. In addition
you can use a laser beam to fend off the emerging meteorites.</p><p>These projects were then proudly presented by the participants during showtime.
We were also delighted to see the new faces among the mentors.</p></section></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Mit &lt;3 gemacht vom CoderDojo Schöneweide Team</p><p>Auf GitHub gehostet</p><ul><li><a href=/de/impressum/>Impressum</a></li><li><a href=/de/datenschutz/>Datenschutz</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script><script src=/js/privacy-notice.js></script></body></html>

You&rsquo;re probably thinking that something visible to you readers has changed. But when developing websites, a lot happens in the background that you don&rsquo;t usually see directly. Our project was about simplifying the creation of these blog posts. Before our project, the creation of blog articles was much more complicated and very technical. As our team is of course not just made up of tech-savvy people, we wanted to simplify the whole process of creating/editing a blog post. To do this, we looked at a few solutions that make it easy to edit content on websites. We came across a content management system.</p><h2 id=what-exactly-is-a-content-management-system-cms>What exactly is a content management system (CMS)?</h2><p>A content management system (CMS) is software that enables users to create, manage and publish content (e.g. text, images, videos) for a website without the need for programming skills. It makes it easier to organize, manage and update content on a website.</p><h2 id=how-exactly-did-we-integrate-the-cms>How exactly did we integrate the CMS?</h2><p>We chose Netlify CMS as our CMS because it met all our requirements and offers a very simple interface. Here is a small excerpt from the CMS while I am writing this blog article:</p><p><img src=/images/cms/screenshot-from-2023-01-27-13-03-30.png alt title="Screenshot of the new CMS"></p><p>With the new CMS, it is now much easier to write a blog article for the website without any understanding of code. The CMS also offers the option of creating drafts so that unfinished articles can be saved temporarily but do not yet appear on the website.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-create-a-new-blog-post>How do I create a new blog post?</h2><p>This is super simple in itself, but should not be part of this blog post, so I will simply link to our <a href=https://github.com/Coderdojo-Schoeneweide/website-hugo/blob/master/how-to-blog.md>Wiki</a>, where the instructions can be found.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Overall, we had a lot of fun integrating the CMS and we are very happy with the result. Integrating Netlify was relatively easy and the CMS is really super powerful if you just want to write simple blog posts on your website. We hope you enjoyed this little look behind the scenes and if you are an editor for our website, have fun using the new CMS.</p></section></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Mit &lt;3 gemacht vom CoderDojo Schöneweide Team</p><p>Auf GitHub gehostet</p><ul><li><a href=/de/impressum/>Impressum</a></li><li><a href=/de/datenschutz/>Datenschutz</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script><script src=/js/privacy-notice.js></script></body></html>

An experience report</h1><p>In the middle of the summer vacations, the sun only peeked through the clouds from time to time on Thursday, but there was no end of fun programming games.<br><figure><img src=images/Picknick.jpeg width=90%><figcaption><h4>Programmieren unter freiem Himmel - ein erster Eindruck</h4></figcaption></figure></p><p><img src=/images/cms/juli-workshop_picknick.jpeg alt title="Open-air programming - a first impression"></p><p>Under the open sky in a relaxed picnic atmosphere, all participants were finally able to talk to each other in person. It was a bit unusual for everyone to get to know each other first, but eventually everyone had their say (including the parents! :)) to talk about their vacation experiences.</p><p>Then it was off to the wooden tables, in front of the laptops, and everyone threw themselves into developing with Scratch. While the participating children gave free rein to their creative ideas, they always had the opportunity to get help and suggestions from their parents, younger siblings or the mentors.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src=/images/cms/juli-workshop_weltraumkatze.png alt title=Spacecat></td><td><img src=/images/cms/juli-workshop_beatboxing.png alt title="Ball in the park"></td><td><img src=/images/cms/juli-workshop_panzer.png alt title="Tank labyrinth"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This resulted in a wide variety of projects, not all of which really had anything to do with the “perfect summer”. The video with the space cat communicating with the earth, for example, the clip with the two people playing ball in front of the beatbox and the tank maze.</p><p>In order to be able to present each project in the final round, there was a large screen on which everyone had the courage to present their own work. The participants also enthusiastically took the opportunity to steer the tank through the maze themselves.</p><p><img src=/images/cms/juli-workshop_abschluss.jpeg alt title="Final round in front of the big screen"></p><p>We had a lot of fun at this live workshop, we were able to support the participants well overall and are delighted with the results! We look forward to the next round of programming together.</p></section></main><footer class=wrapper><p>Mit &lt;3 gemacht vom CoderDojo Schöneweide Team</p><p>Auf GitHub gehostet</p><ul><li><a href=/de/impressum/>Impressum</a></li><li><a href=/de/datenschutz/>Datenschutz</a></li></ul></footer><script src=/js/filters.js></script></body></html>

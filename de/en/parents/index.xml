With us, it&amp;rsquo;s all about having fun. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important for you as a parent to support your child optimally.
Consider:
your child&amp;rsquo;s individual learning style, including factors like concentration and their own problem-solving methods. your child wants to pursue their own project, not yours! feel free to assist with problems through targeted questions. sometimes, just showing that parents make mistakes too is enough.</description></item><item><title>What is the CoderDojo? - For parents</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/parents/infos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/parents/infos/</guid><description>What is the aim of CoderDojo Schöneweide? CoderDojo Schöneweide is an organisation that aims to teach children and young people about programming in a fun way. You can find a short teaser video here.
Can my child take part? Yes.
However, it would be helpful if they can already read. We also have an upper age limit of 17 years (17 years is ok, 18 is not). After that, you are welcome to join as a mentor :)</description></item></channel></rss>

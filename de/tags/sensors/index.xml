Participants can create an animation lasting a maximum of 30 seconds, in which at least the humidity on the ISS is displayed. In addition, participants can greet the astronauts, display the air pressure and temperature or add pictures.</description></item><item><title>mBot Obstacle Course</title><link>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/workshops/mbot-labyrinth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/de/en/workshops/mbot-labyrinth/</guid><description>In the online workshop &amp;ldquo;mBot Obstacle Course,&amp;rdquo; participants navigate an mBot through an obstacle course. After a programming phase, two teams compete against each other: Who can be the first to burst the balloon in the middle of the course? Line and proximity sensors are used for traversing the course.
The mBlock programs for controlling the mBots are shared by the participants with on-site mentors, who then execute the programs. Since the mBots are captured by a camera mounted on the ceiling, participants can follow live to see if their program is working.</description></item></channel></rss>
